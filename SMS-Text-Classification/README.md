# SMS-Text-Classification
freeCodeCamp project to create a machine learning model that will classify SMS messages as either "ham" or "spam". A "ham" message is a normal message sent by a friend. A "spam" message is an advertisement or a message sent by a company.

The data is included in the repository. It was obtained from the following links:
Train data: `https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/project-data/sms/train-data.tsv`
Validation data: `https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/project-data/sms/valid-data.tsv`

Pretrained sentence embeddings were used to convert the data into vectors. A simple feed forward network was used as the model. Highest recorded validation accuracy was 98.92%.
