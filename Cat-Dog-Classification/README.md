# freeCodeCamp-Cat-Dog-Classification
A ResNet Convolutional architecture for a classification task to distinguish between cats and dogs 

The freeCodeCamp link to the project is here: `https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/machine-learning-with-python-projects/cat-and-dog-image-classifier`

The data can be downloaded using this link: `https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/project-data/cats-and-dogs/cats_and_dogs.zip`


If you download the data on Windows, be sure to delete the `.DS_Store` files because they're unnecessary (wiping the `__MACOSX` folder as well since it's useless too).
